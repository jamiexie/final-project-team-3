    "\n",
    "This project attempts to reproduce analysis on the most common names in the U.S. Five-Thirty-Eight. The original analysis used data from the SSA to find the most common names since 1910 and adjusted for Hispanic and Latino populations. In our recreation of this analysis, we will attempt to reproduce their results and comment on possible problems that the original analysis did not cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is from the [Github repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data.git) containing the original tables on which the analysis was performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The coding analysis will attempt to reproduce their analysis of the data to see if we can come up with the same most common name in the U.S. using their guidelines. We will also consider possible ways in which the original analysis could be improved upon.\n",
