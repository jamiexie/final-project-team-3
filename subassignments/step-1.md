# Step 1 Assignment

We are doing a performing a reproduction analysis from an article titled "Dear Mona, What's the Most Common Name in America?" This article described the methodology for finding the most common first and last name combination in the U.S in 2013. It is hosted on the FiveThirtyEight website and was written by Mona Chalabi and Andrew Flowers. The data from the original analysis can be found in this [Github repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data.git)

# What is the quality (you can use F.A.I.R) of the information?
  * F - The data was definitely easy to find. We were able to find a GitHub repository containing the data for the original analysis in the form of csv files. The article also describes the methodology for the original analysis and also contains graphs and additional information about the statistical methods in the footnotes. 
  * A - Since the data is in a GitHub repository, we were able to easily access the data. 
  * I - The data is interoperable because it was gathered from different sources in file formats that were easy to use so the data can be used in different applications.
  * R - The article was describes the overall steps of the original analysis but does not go into specific detail about the specific statistical methods used. As a result, we may have some difficulty reproducing the analysis.
  
# What is the provenance and collection method of the data?
  * The data was collected from the Social Security Administration and U.S Census Bureau websites. As a result, this data is reliable. 
  
# What are the hypotheses of the project?
  * Based on the question asked by the reader, the study hypothesized the John Smith was the most common first and last name combination in 2013.
  
# What are the research methods?
  * The research methods involved performing three adjustments on the data. The first adjustment was on the data from the SSA of the first names of popular baby names. The study used actuarial data to factor in the life-expectancy of people to adjust the popularity of those names in 2013. Because a portion of the U.S. population was not born in the U.S., the study performed a second adjustment to the data by factoring in the proportion of the Hispanic population in the U.S. to the popularity of baby names from the SSA. Lastly, they performed an adjustment to the first and last name combinations to account for certain name combinations that are more popular than others.
